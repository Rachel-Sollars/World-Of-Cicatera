# What Was The Split? #

The split was an occurrence of magic welling up deep within the earth. 

The explosive power of this burst of magic resulted in the dramatic changing of the terrain of Cicatera, leaving it scarred by a huge mountain range crossing the continent from east to west. The largest mountain is found in the center of the range, and marks where the majority of the magic sprung forth. This mountain is named [name] and is still considered the most magical place on the continent thousands of years later.

The magic, bursting forth from the fracture rained down upon the Continent. This led to changes in the Animals, The People, the plants, and the land itself. Nature was the fastest to evolve to this new power, with plants moving as though sentient, and animals growing limbs, increasing in size, or gaining Magics never before seen.

The sudden change in the careful balance of nature led to the eradication of much of the human population as they struggled to adapt to new threats. Over time, however, individuals started being born with strength and magic that allowed them to rival that of the world around them. 

The increased rate of evolution as well as strong environmental pressures faced by small tribes of humans led to an evolutionary divergence; from the forests came the elves and orks, from the mountains came the dwarfs and gnomes, and the planes were conquered by humans and halflings.
