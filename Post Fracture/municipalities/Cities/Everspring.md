# Food
The majority of food comes from farms in surrounding settlements. These villages provide food as a form of taxation in return for promise of protection offered by the everspring guard.
# Drink 
Water is provided by the everspring in limitless quantities. Wine and ale are acquired through trade with nearby settlements carried out by private businesses. 
# The Everspring
The Everspring is a spring that flows from the center of the city. Its flow has never faltered and it runs clean with drinkable water. The overflow runs through gutters in the street out to the moat. The Everspring is used as a symbol of religeous importance by the church of everspring, who worship a god of bounty.
